# lotto-randomizer
Simple script that gets random numbers to play lottery games.

## Workflow
This app is just a simple pseudo-random number generator that asks user which lottery game he wants to get the numbers for.
After making the choice, several numbers are being picked and are shown to the user.

**The app is best used locally by creating an executable out of it, so that it's even easier to run.**
